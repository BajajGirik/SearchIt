# SearchIt
This is a web scraper that works on flipkart.\
This web scrapper has a variable called "url" that contains flipkart's url of the product.\
This program tells whether the product is available or not... If it is available, it will open your browser and redirect you to the flipkart's product page.\
I am currently looking for the availability of ps5... So I thought of making this program to check daily whether it is available or not.

#Requirements
